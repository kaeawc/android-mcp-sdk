- **Tabbed examples**: Multiple language examples in organized tabs

## Impact on Developer Workflow

### Before Documentation

- Developers had to figure out ADB port forwarding manually
- No comprehensive testing guidance
- Limited troubleshooting resources
- Fragmented examples across different files

### After Documentation

- **Copy-paste ready**: All commands and examples are immediately usable
- **Comprehensive testing**: Automated and manual testing fully documented
- **Production-ready**: Security and best practices clearly outlined

## Next Steps for Documentation

The ADB port forwarding documentation is now **complete and integrated**. Future enhancements could
include:

1. **Video tutorials**: Screen recordings of the setup process
2. **Interactive examples**: Live code examples or sandboxes
3. **Framework-specific guides**: Detailed integration for specific MCP client frameworks
4. **Advanced networking**: VPN and remote development scenarios

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
