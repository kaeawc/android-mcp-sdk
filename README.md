# Android MCP SDK

An Android library that integrates the [MCP Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk) to enable Android applications to host MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
The overall goal is to enable Android apps to provide MCP servers access to AI tools in development environments.

## Quick Start

Add the library to your Android project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.jasonpearson:mcp-android-sdk:1.0.0")
}
```

Unless you need to remove or delay the MCP server startup it'll be there in debug variants. I'm making it impossible to include in release variants for now.

## Features

- âœ… Full MCP specification support (tools, resources, prompts)
- âœ… Built-in Android-specific tools and resources
- âœ… WebSocket and HTTP/SSE transport layers
- âœ… AndroidX Startup automatic initialization
- âœ… Thread-safe singleton management
- âœ… Comprehensive lifecycle management
