# Task 05: HTTP/SSE Transport Implementation

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The HTTP/SSE transport layer has been successfully implemented in `HttpSseTransport.kt`.

## Implementation Details

The HTTP/SSE transport is located at:

- `core/src/main/kotlin/dev/jasonpearson/mcpandroidsdk/transport/HttpSseTransport.kt`

This transport provides:

- Server-Sent Events (SSE) support for real-time communication
- HTTP endpoints for MCP protocol communication
- Integration with the TransportManager

## Verification

The transport implementation can be verified by:

1. **Build verification**:

```bash
./gradlew :core:compileDebugKotlin
```

2. **Sample app build**:

```bash
./gradlew :samples:simple:assembleDebug
```

Both commands complete successfully, confirming the transport implementation is functional.

## Next Steps

This task is complete. For transport testing and validation, see:

- [09-integration-testing-suite.md](09-integration-testing-suite.md)

### Testing

```bash
./gradlew :samples:simple:assembleDebug
./gradlew :samples:simple:installDebug
```
