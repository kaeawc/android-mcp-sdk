# Task 24: Network Request Replay

## Status: `[C]` Complete

## Objective

Implement network request replay functionality, enabling MCP clients to reproduce, modify, and
replay captured network requests for testing and debugging purposes.

## Requirements

- **Request Reproduction**: Replay captured requests with original or modified parameters ✅
- **Batch Replay**: Execute multiple requests in sequence or parallel ✅
- **Request Modification**: Edit headers, body, parameters before replay ✅
- **Response Comparison**: Compare replayed responses with originals ✅
- **Load Testing**: Replay requests with different timing and concurrency ✅

## Implementation Completed

### NetworkReplayEngine Implementation

**Core Features Implemented:**

- ✅ Single request replay with modification support
- ✅ Batch request replay with concurrency control
- ✅ Load testing with performance statistics
- ✅ Session management and tracking
- ✅ Response comparison and analysis
- ✅ Request modification framework

**Key Classes:**

- `NetworkReplayEngine`: Main replay engine with comprehensive functionality
- `RequestModifications`: Data class for request parameter modifications
- `ReplayResult`: Complete result with comparison and performance data
- `LoadTestStatistics`: Detailed performance metrics (RPS, percentiles, error rates)

### MCP Tools Integration

Added three new network replay tools to `NetworkToolProvider`:

1. **`network_replay_request`**: Replay individual captured requests
    - Supports URL, method, header, and body modifications
    - Provides detailed comparison with original response
    - Shows performance differences (timing, size)

2. **`network_batch_replay`**: Replay multiple requests efficiently
    - Configurable concurrency and delays
    - Fail-fast or continue-on-error modes
    - Comprehensive batch statistics

3. **`network_load_test`**: Perform load testing with captured requests
    - Configurable request rate and concurrency
    - Detailed performance statistics (P50, P95, P99 percentiles)
    - Error rate tracking and throughput analysis

### Technical Highlights

**Concurrency Control:**

- Semaphore-based request limiting
- Configurable batch processing
- Rate limiting for load tests

**Performance Monitoring:**

- Response time percentile calculations
- Throughput and error rate tracking
- Request per second measurements

**Request Modification:**

- Header addition, modification, and removal
- URL and HTTP method changes
- Request body replacement
- Timeout configuration

**Response Analysis:**

- Status code comparison
- Header difference detection
- Response body comparison
- Size and timing change tracking

## Testing

- Unit tests implemented for core functionality
- Test coverage for modification scenarios
- Error handling validation
- Session management verification

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Single request replay working
- ✅ Batch replay functionality complete
- ✅ Request modification capabilities active
- ✅ Load testing features functional
- ✅ Response comparison available
- ✅ MCP tool integration complete

## Completion Summary

**Task 24 is now complete.** The NetworkReplayEngine provides comprehensive network request replay
capabilities, including:

- **3 new MCP tools** for single, batch, and load test scenarios
- **Full request modification** support (URL, method, headers, body)
- **Advanced performance analytics** with percentile calculations
- **Response comparison** to detect differences from original requests
- **Production-ready implementation** with proper error handling and concurrency control

This completes the network debugging suite for the Android MCP SDK, providing developers with
powerful tools to replay, modify, and analyze network requests captured during app execution.
