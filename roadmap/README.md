# Android MCP SDK Roadmap

This directory contains detailed task specifications for completing the Android MCP SDK implementation. Each file represents a specific task that needs to be completed for production readiness.

Still Missing/Incomplete:
1. TODOs in Code:
    Resource subscription logic file observers in ResourceProvider.kt
    Sampling requests to clients in AndroidMcpServerImpl.kt
    JSON-RPC message parsing in McpAndroidServer.kt
2. Transport Layer (Partially Complete):
    The README claims WebSocket/HTTP/SSE are implemented, but from TODOs it seems incomplete
    Need to verify actual transport implementation vs claimed capability
3. File System Resources:
    Claims "proper Android permissions" but needs verification of actual implementation
4. Database Resources:
    Still marked as "Next Steps" - not implemented
5. Integration Testing:
    No end-to-end testing with actual MCP clients
    No testing of adb port forwarding workflow
    No validation that transport layer actually works
6. Documentation Gaps:
    Sample app exists but may need more comprehensive examples
    Integration guides mentioned but not visible in current structure
    Testing Needed:
        Build and run the sample app to verify it actually works
        Test transport connections via adb forwarding
        Validate MCP client communication end-to-end
        Test all built-in tools actually function
        Verify resource access and permissions work correctly
        The project is very close to complete but has several TODOs and integration testing gaps that should be addressed for production readiness.

## Task Execution Guidelines

Each task file contains:
- **Objective**: Clear description of what needs to be accomplished
- **Requirements**: Technical requirements and constraints
- **Implementation Steps**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **Verification Steps**: How to verify the task is complete
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed first
- **Resources**: Links to relevant documentation and examples

## Status Tracking

Tasks should be marked as:
- `[ ]` Not Started
- `[P]` In Progress  
- `[T]` Testing/Verification
- `[C]` Complete
- `[B]` Blocked (waiting for dependency)

Update this README.md with status as tasks are completed.
